        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Mountain Metrics is a small project by a couple of skiers.  We wanted a place to get all the info we need to head out to the resort or the backcountry.  We found ourself checking a bunch of different sites and not getting all the info we needed.  So we built Mountain Metrics and optimized it for mobile devices so we could check out the conditions when we are out enjoying the snow.  Have fun out there and be safe!</p>
